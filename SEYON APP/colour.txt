Great choice. The "Divine Warmth" palette is excellent for a devotional app because it feels sacred but remains easy on the eyes.
Since your Cards, Alert Boxes, and Toasts will have a White (#FFFFFF) background, here is the specific text color breakdown to maintain that "neat and clean" hierarchy.
I have separated them by Hierarchy (Importance) to guide the user's eye naturally.

1. The Titles (Headings, Song Names, Alert Headers)
You want the titles to stand out immediately but not look harsh.

    Color: Burnt Orange (#E65100)

    Why: Using the primary color for titles on white cards links the content to your theme without overpowering the screen. It looks very polished.
Font Weight: Bold (700)

2. The Body Text (Lyrics, Story Paragraphs, Alert Messages)
This is the most important part for reading. Do not use the orange color here. It must be a neutral dark color for eye comfort.

    Color: Dark Charcoal (#212121)

    Why: Pure black (#000000) on pure white can cause eye strain (vibrating effect). This "Dark Charcoal" is soft enough to be comfortable but dark enough to be perfectly readable.  
Font Weight: Regular (400)

3. The Secondary Text (Subtitles, Authors, "Read More", Dates)
This is for information that is less important than the main story.

    Color: Warm Grey (#757575)

    Why: This pushes the text into the background slightly, letting the Title and Body take center stage.

    Font Weight: Medium (500) or Regular (400)

4. Interactive Text (Buttons, "OK", "Cancel", Links)
Color: Deep Saffron (#FF9933) (The lighter of your two oranges)

    Why: It signals to the user "You can click this."
